# Progress Ring

The Progress Ring control is styled after a similar control in Windows 8 to indicate activity rather than a percentage of progress completed.
``<Controls:ProgressRing IsActive="True" />``

`IsActive` can easily be bound to a view model property. Override `Foreground` if you wish to change the colour.
